I made a survey that will ask the user about their thoughts and experience with space, planets, and the stars


## [Q5]

2 short answers, one multiple-choice



## [Q6]

> `responses.csv`.
Don't input a name into the name textbox.

> filled out your survey.

## [Q8]
> Name at least one classmate who loaded *your* visualization in their
> own browser using the URL you sent them.
Dean Le



## [Q9]
> Give a few sentences on what you think about the actual results of
> your survey. Did you discover anything interesting? What does your
> visualization tell us about the data?
Though the data is very small, it is interesting to see that more people pu they would rather live on Saturn, which could imply that people would want to move away from the Sun.

> **Save an image of your visualization** as `graph.png` and submit
> that along with everything else for this lab.



## [Q10]
> Name one of your classmates whose visualization you looked at in
> your web browser using their URL. Who is the classmate, and say a
> sentence or two on what you think about the results of their survey.
Dean Le did a survey on the worst core classes at USNA, and through survey found that most people think that Chem 2 was the worst class so far.


## [Q11]
> What sources of help (if any) did you utilize to complete this lab?
Gemini Gem
Collaboration with Dean Le


## [Q12]
> What did you think of the lab overall?
I thought that this lab was a good experience, and I hope to see us use this for real-world application in the future. I felt that it did a good job incorporating aspects of Data Science as opposed to raw coding that you might find when trying to make a website as a CS major or similar.
