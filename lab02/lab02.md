## [name] Type your name on the next line


## [Q1]
> What is the URL of your "hello" page?



## [Q2]

> refresh your "hello" page. The Python terminal should spit out a
> single line to tell you that that page was just accessed and that
> everything went smoothly. Copy-paste that line for this question.



## [Q3]
> Access a classmate's "hello" page. What is their URL and what is the
> message that you see?



## [Q4]
> What is your survey about?



## [Q5]
> How many short-answer and multiple-choice questions does your survey
> have? (Remember, it should have at least one of each kind.)



## [Q6]
> Describe one specific way I could submit your survey form so that it
> triggers your error checking and does *not* get recorded in
> `responses.csv`.



## [Q7]
> Enter the names of **at least three** classmates who successfully
> filled out your survey.



## [Q8]
> Name at least one classmate who loaded *your* visualization in their
> own browser using the URL you sent them.



## [Q9]
> Give a few sentences on what you think about the actual results of
> your survey. Did you discover anything interesting? What does your
> visualization tell us about the data?

> **Save an image of your visualization** as `graph.png` and submit
> that along with everything else for this lab.



## [Q10]

> your web browser using their URL. Who is the classmate, and say a
